Hi,

I've made this website mainly as a sandbox for trying out new things I've been learning. 
It's based on a championship me and a few of my family have had where we try to predict the winners of each F1 race, we'll all chip in to pay the winner's goKarting when we all go. 

How it's looking at the moment: 

- It's a basic HTML & CSS website.
- Included some vanilla JavaScript to render the current date as well as a countdown to the next race start time. 
- I've added a vanilla JavaScript "Random top 3" generator which can also be hidden and re-shown without re-setting the previous list. 
- Contains a few links to the official F1 website as well as a funny one about Mazepin spinning (which has become a regular occurance this year in F1). 
- General styling is basic and loosly based on the official F1 website.
