Hi,

I've made this website mainly as a sandbox for trying out new things I've been learning. 
I've also been using this to get to grips with Git Version control and have been using the command line to do so. 
It's based on a championship me and a few of my family have been running between us, where we try to predict the winners of each F1 race, we'll all chip in to pay the winner's goKarting when we all go at the end of the year.  

How it's looking at the moment: 

- It's a basic HTML, CSS & vanilla JS website.
- Manually have to update the scores each week which are kept track of via a Excel sheet (the excel sheet calculates scores etc. using some formulas to make it quick and easy).
- Included some vanilla JavaScript to render the current date as well as a countdown to the next race start time. 
- I've added a vanilla JavaScript "Random top 3" generator which can also be hidden and re-shown without re-setting the previous list. 
- Contains a few links to the official F1 website as well as a funny one about Mazepin spinning (which has become a regular occurance this year in F1). 
- General styling is basic and loosly based on the official F1 website. 

I haven't got many plans at the moment to add much more to this other than potentially improving the styling - although it would be cool to find an F1 API to incorporate which could render some upto date results potentially.
